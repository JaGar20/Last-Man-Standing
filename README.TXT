USER INSTRUCTIONS:



---- CONTROLS ----

You are the Solider who is using the Artillery to attack the enemies (opposing soldiers). 

UP = "UP ARROW KEY"
DOWN = "DOWN ARROW KEY"
SHOOT = "SPACE KEY"

The shooting will have a reload time that varies in two stages. You won't go left and right in this game.



---- STAGE 1: BATTLEFIELD ----

These enemies will randomly spawn from right to left and will start shooting at you quickly. In the Battlefield, the enemies walk faster and shoots you. When they shoot and touch you, you lose 20 points. When you shoot at the enemies, they will be eliminated once and the score increase by 20

The health will spawn randomly, in the y axis that the artillery soldier is at. The health will increase the score by 30. The first stage will include a timer.  

In order to win, you have to reach 300 points and when the time reaches to 0. The only way to gain points is to shoot at the soldiers and obtain health which is the "+" sign. Dodging the bullet will not lose any points, it is only defense mechanism in this game.



---- STAGE 2: WINTERFIELD ----

When is cold, everything goes slow. The soldier will still have the movement speed up and down. The reloading speed will be much slower and the enemies will walk slower since its snow. They will randomly spawn right to left and will shoot at you, but in a slower rate (They have slower reload time). 

The damage increase from 20 to 40, so this stage is challenging. The health will increase from 20 to 50. The image is different from red to purple/blue to represent winter.

In order to win, you have to reach 600 points and when the time reach to 0. The only way to gain points is to shoot at the soldiers and obtain health which is the "+" sign. Dodging the bullet will not lose any points, it is only defense mechanism in this game.
